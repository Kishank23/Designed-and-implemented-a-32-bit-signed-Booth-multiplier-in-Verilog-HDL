# Designed-and-implemented-a-32-bit-signed-Booth-multiplier-in-Verilog-HDL
– Employed the Booth algorithm to optimize multiplication, reducing the number of partial products and enhancing
performance over conventional shift-and-add techniques.
– Conducted extensive testing and validation to guarantee the accuracy of multiplication of two 16-bit signed numbers
and meet performance criteria.
